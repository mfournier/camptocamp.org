The SVG files here are not the source for most of the pictos we have.

However, at some point, it will be neccessary to have a svg version of our pictos, so that we can provide them at different sizes etc...

Thus, the idea is here to recreate a SVG version of our pictos, for future use. When relevant, please try to keep the SVG so that the rendered png is as similar as the existing ones

nb: some of the SVG are derived from the tango project (http://tango.freedesktop.org/), released in the public domain
    some other are taken from the Creative Commons website (http://creativecommons.org/about/downloads)


==== About @2x and @1.5x files ====
They are used for devices with pixel ratio > 1
For @2x, it is quite straightforward, but for @1.5x, it can be problematic for pictos with even dimensions (e.g. 25x25px)
In such cases, tests have shown that in general it is better looking if we use one pixel more than one pixel left (e.g. 38x38px rather than 37x37px)

Also it might be possible that for such pictos, we keep the @1x version since it is not so important (eg partners logo in footer) or not really better
looking and thus not worth the additional bytes cost

nb. you can see which files are using @x versions when running the build file from css directory: a warning is issued
when the default image is used (this warning doesn't appear when using c2corg though)
